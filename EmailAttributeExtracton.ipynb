The majority of testing kits that exist in the U.S. presently, identifies 2 genes of the virus and has a 85-90% accuracy. Understanding that African- Americans (AA) represent nearly 1/3 of all current Covid-19 cases, their primary focus is distribution of these kits to those AA communities with the greatest need. \\nHere's a link to a video about our manufacturer of the kits: \\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/International/video/south-korean-company-aims-fill-gap-testing-supply-70255119 \\nPlease provide And requirements to submit our proposal to help addressing this health crisis, via testing & Awareness. \\nWe hope as a minority-owned company, that there is an immediate opportunity to provide Fulton County with both COVID-19 test kits and marketing. \\nThank you.

My company, Strother Nursing & Surgical Services L.L.C., is in a partnership agreement with KAG1 which is the Healthcare Procurement Branch of the partnership. Please visit the website below and go to the news section to see the great things we are doing. After seeing one of your cities Pastors on CNN this Sunday, Pastor Jamal Bryant, my partners and I were moved by his plea to get more testing in Atlanta. We have agreed to lower some of the cost of the test kits, changing the price from $20 a kit to $18. More than making a profit we are concerned about helping as many people as possible get tested. The only breakthrough for this Pandemic is widespread testing. And hopefully we can help your city and state reach that point. I will be in surgery for the next couple of hours. So if you would like to schedule a call please let me know. Thanks again and stay at home and virus free. \\nhttps://www.kag1inc.com/news \\n<STROTHER NURSING & SURGICAL SERVICES L.L.C.

Having watched Trumps press conference yesterday where every mass retailer from WalMart to RiteAid got up and described testing plans, am struck by futility of trying to control a rollout versus focusing on results and where to add value. \\nWe debated in telecom about who should control the content and finally decided to let a thousand flowers bloom....and add value in other ways such as broadband, wireless mobility, security, etc, Of course, now AT&T has purchased Time Warner :-) \\nIn testing, perhaps we add value in various ways...optimal site selection, awareness marketing from a trusted source, best practices in running a SPOC and data analysis by BOH....but we dont try to control a mass market roll-out. \\nLets do some more thinking and discuss. \\nDick \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\n', 'from': ' Anderson, Dick ', 'to': ' Paxton, Lynn; Kallmyer, Matthew; Roach, Anna; Whitmore, Sharon; Corbitt, Jessica; Adams, Alton; Roshell, Pamela; Kirby, Ellis ', 'date': ' Tuesday, April 28, 2020 8:20:50 AM ', 'subject': ' COVID-19 Testing '}, {'id': 16, 'full_text': 'From: Henry, Mitsah \\nTo: Anderson, Dick \\nCc: Arrington, Marvin S; Simmons, Dorsha; Knight, Monique \\nSubject: COVID-19 Virtual Town Hall - Agenda and Flyer \\nDate: Tuesday, April 28, 2020 3:13:04 PM \\nAttachments: D5VirtualTownHallAgenda April 2020.pdf townhall .jpg \\nGood afternoon Mr. Anderson, \\nOn behalf of Vice-Chair Arrington, we look forward to having you present at our virtual town hall Wednesday, April 28, 2020, 12pm-1pm.

It forms the basis of healthcare capacity planning and now the focus on testing expansion that we will review at the next BOC meeting. By the way, I visited our mobile test site at McGhee tennis center yesterday and saw approximately 50 people in line \\nfor a test. \\nAs we have moved through this crisis, am reminded of the conversation and concerns expressed early on by Calvin regarding our thin management structure in EMA. Have moved to do three things and will bring forward a recommendation that I hope you will support:\\n 1) Reduce reliance on EMSI consulting\\n 2) Build management strength including a Deputy position\\n 3) Increase diversity of team \\nHave been able to recruit Jack Butler (African American) back from COSF to run Fire at Airport and EMS coordination county wide. Jack was one of key Deputy Chiefs in Fulton County Fire. Have also been able to recruit Joe Barasoain (Cuban American) to stay as Deputy for EMA as opposed to leaving to \\nbe a consultant. Joe is taking the primary lead to set up the SPOC testing sites. \\nWill propose that we align EMA with these positions and then adjust Matts salary accordingly, but keep EMA in alignment with FCPD Chief and Deputy Chief salary grades. Am also reducing EMSI by two thirds and negotiating with a minority consultant to focus exclusively on PPE \\nprocurement. I think this gives me the team needed to execute during this crisis.

County tag offices should be prepared for increased walk-ins after June 15 and develop a plan for social distancing to protect staff and residents.

I did visits with Cobb and DeKalb SPOCs this week to get thoughts on what is working/not working. I haven\\'t known who to talk to about what Cobb is doing, but they process significantly more specimens than we do in much less time with far fewer staff members. Their system almost completely eliminates the need for schedulers and our WebEOC acheduling board. It also improves accuracy of data, while decreasing the number of Registration staff needed, reducing time spent entering data in SENDSS, allows for PUIs to be tested without an \"appointment\", and provides for a way to document consent for the BOH to contact. \\nFrom my experience working closely with the schedulers and Registration, I see where a rapid rollout of added schedulers may lead to an increase in errors that will need to be addressed at Registration (thereby increasing the time it takes to takes to move PUIs through the queue), issues around pacing appointments, errors with specimen count data (Tenny and I worked through one of these Friday), and increased challenges around communicating changes is plans/operations.

Like millions of workers across America, my co-workers and I are a community that has risked our lives and compromised the health of family as well as ourselves in the midst of performing a job deemed essential for society. The extreme sacrifices we continue to make as frontline workers require an immediate response to those whose loved ones are booked-in and hopefully released as the jail continues to house those that have been infected and those that may be carriers of the virus as well. \\nWe trust on a daily basis that this facility will provide life-saving personal protective \\nequipment (PPE) to shield us from this invisible enemy as well as provide stringent safety measures also. On March 20, 2020, we were provided with one N95 mask for the duration of this epidemic but can go through other measures to receive an additional one. This is unacceptable! But yet and still we arrive to work for our regularly scheduled shift. \\nIncluded in the mainstream media news on April 13, 2020 was the Fulton County Jail being sanitized and cleaned in order to aid in the eradication of the virus within the jail. We were ecstatic to hear the news except the Active Records Department was not included. We encounter those same inmates and officers that are in constant contact with the inmates housed in the jail. As of May 5, 2020, the Active Records department remains unscathed! In lieu of our department being included in the sanitation, we are asked to upkeep our area until further notice. When will we receive our initial sanitizing of our department? But yet and still we are essential to the process! \\nMany of us are the sole providers for our family. It is not enough to express our deepest concerns and they be ignored. We are held to the same standards of reporting come inclement weather in addition to presently reporting through this global pandemic. You will never feel nor understand the pain that we feel until you have actually worn our shoes. We hold the decision makers to a higher standard in making well thought out decisions. One can imagine the consequences the jail as a whole would suffer if the entire Intake and Booking as well as the Active Records Department would have only thought of our immediate family as well as ourselves. The results would have been detrimental to the entire Fulton County Jail. We value our jobs as well as our families and know that we need both to sustain. \\nFrom Doctors to delivery drivers, grocery store workers and care providers, detention officers to us as Criminal Investigation Service Technicians we are essential to the process. The panic on our faces are not seen while performing our duties and then go home to family in hopes that we have not contracted the virus nor transmitted it to anyone else. There should be no excuse why we are not included in the hazardous benefits. We are the ones taking the risk! We are the ones included in the exposure to COVID-19 in order to continue processing in-coming and releasing inmates. \\nHonestly, we cannot put an amount on how much is enough at risking our lives but what should be considered is our safety, our health and those again we compromise. Those included in our chain of command have expressed their gratitude but with this type of unprecedented event and high exposure a simply thank you is not enough! \\nLet this resonate from those that work the frontlineThose that are considered non-essential have to remain sheltered-in-place! Those that are deemed essential have to report! We know we are essential show us by allowing us to reap the benefits. \\nJ.

thanks for your note and I do appreciate your concerns. \\nThe standard we used to determine eligibility for hazardous pay was....departments identified by the US Department of Labor as generally involved in hazardous duty and then employees directly interacting with the public on a daily basis. \\nWe have many folks in the Sheriff, Marshal, PD, Courts, and Public Works departments that are reporting to work each day and not receiving hazardous pay due to their job responsibilities. \\nAnd we reviewed submissions by each department including FCPD in great detail to make a decision. As example, we didnt include the FCPD Chief or Deputy Chief. \\nOur overall focus was to keep all of our employees on the payroll without the uncertainty of layoffs or furloughs. As you know, almost 1 in 5 of all Georgia workers have now filed for unemployment indicating a historic high. With the support of the BOC, we have been able to do so as well as provide hazardous pay for employees directly interacting with the public. \\nSo, we have great appreciation for all of our FC employees and think these actions demonstrate that commitment. \\nDick \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\nOn May 3, 2020, at 6:44 AM, James, Diara <Diara.James@fultoncountyga.gov> wrote: \\nGood morning Mr. Anderson, \\nI am currently assigned to the Police Department -GCIC Section Morning Watch. I was told on Saturday, May 2, 2020 that our division is Not eligible for Hazard Pay after being told we were eligible a couple of weeks ago. Mr. Anderson I am so confused as to why we are no longer eligible. The Police Officers nor 911 cannot function without us and we cannot operate without them. Our 12 person staff not only services The Fulton County PD but we also service Palmetto PD/Fulton County School PD/Fairburn PD/Union City PD/Department of Juvenile Justice and City of South Fulton PD. We form a triangle C The Police/911 and GCIC whom all perform critical duties. Maybe it was not fully explained what exactly it is we do. \\nMr. Anderson if one of your love ones were missing and you wanted the police to assist with locating them, the first line of contact would be 911. Then 911 would dispatch an officer to your location to collect information so your love one can be placed on a National System which is GCIC/NCIC. That officer/detective would then forward the collected information to Fulton County GCIC for entry. That information is entered by one of our 12 GCIC Operators who work 24/7 all 365 days of the year. Any vehicles/wanted persons & articles are also entered by us. If a person commits a Murder in unincorporated Fulton County, that person must be placed on the system so that every police agency in the world is aware the he/she is wanted. That is done by our section. Mr. Anderson with all due respect I really dont understand how 911 Operators are eligible for Hazard Pay and GCIC Operators are not. We both are civilians who do not physically come in contact with the general public but neither of us can operate without the other. \\nThe FCPD has been closed to the public during Covid-19 but NOT GCIC because we are essential. However we have had to fingerprint numerous Officers and Judges during this time and that has placed each staff member in our section in a hazardous environment. If only Sworn Personnel are considered Emergency Essential then maybe we should look at only having officers handling GCIC/ finger printing and civilians should be placed on paid leave like the rest of the county. \\nMr. Anderson I am reaching out to you because I dont know what else to do. It doesnt seem like we have anyone to fight for us so I am willing to speak up on behalf of all 12 persons assigned to our division. I was contacted on Friday, May 1, 2020 by some of my co-workers and they were in tears because they feel unappreciated and hurt by the Personnel Directors decision to not include GCIC Operators in the Hazard Pay. I hope I have not over stepped any boundaries and if you feel I have, I deeply apologize. I just wanted each of my team members to know that they are appreciated and that someone is willing to fight for them!! \\nThanks for all your assistance with this matter and I hope you have a great weekend. \\nDiara S.

I was contacted today by some of my co-workers and they were in tears because they feel unappreciated and hurt by the Boards decision to not include them in the Hazard Pay. I hope I have not over stepped any boundaries and if you feel I have, I deeply apologize. \\nThanks for all your assistance with this matter and I hope you have a great weekend. \\nGCIC Supervisor \\nGCIC/Records, Fulton County Police Department \\n404-613-7211 (office) \\n404-612-3426 (fax) \\nConnect with Fulton County: \\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | FGTV | #OneFulton E-\\nNews \\n\\n', 'from': ' James, Diara ', 'to': ' Hall, Natalie <Natalie.Hall@fultoncountyga.gov>; Arrington, Marvin S <Marvin.Arrington@fultoncountyga.gov> ', 'date': ' Saturday, May 2, 2020 3:57 AM ', 'subject': ' Hazard Pay for GCIC Operators in the Police Department '}, {'id': 145, 'full_text': 'From: Anderson Dick To: Whitmore Sharon; Roach Anna Subject: Fwd: HAZARD PAY Date: Tuesday May 5 2020 7:35:08 PM Attachments: HEV_1561526692380.png \\nFYI \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\nBegin forwarded message \\n', 'from': ' Anderson Dick ', 'to': ' Whitmore Sharon; Roach Anna ', 'date': ' Tuesday May 5 2020 7:35:08 PM ', 'subject': ' Fwd: HAZARD PAY '}, {'id': 146, 'full_text': 'From: \"Hall, Natalie\" <Natalie Hall@fultoncountyga gov> Date: May 5, 2020 at 5 02 56 PM EDT To: \"Glover, Denise\" <Denise.Glover@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Anderson, Dick\" <Dick.Anderson@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Hermon, Kenneth\" <Kenneth.Hermon@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Arrington, Marvin S\" <Marvin.Arrington@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Carn, Joe\" <Joe.Carn2@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Roach, Anna\" <Anna.Roach@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Jones, Stacey1\" <Stacey1.Jones@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Jackson, Ted\" <Ted.Jackson@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Adger, Mark\" <Mark.Adger@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Brock, Calvin\" <Calvin.Brock@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Kirby, Sequoia\" <Sequoia.Kirby@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Kelly, Robert\" <Robert.Kelly@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Harris, Anita\" <Anita.Harris@fultoncountyga.gov> \\nSubject: RE: HAZARD PAY \\nDick and Kenneth, \\nAll of the Sheriff\\'s employees who are working on the front lines and in the jail should be receiving the hazardous pay.

Treasury Department officials \\nGood Afternoon, \\nAs you probably know, yesterday ACCG and GMA submitted the attached letter to Governor Kemp, asking that he make available to cities and counties under 500,000 in population a share of the funding that the state received through the CARES Act. The proposal, if accepted by the Governor, would make the cities (except Atlanta, which got direct funding) within your counties eligible for funding. \\nToday I learned that GMA is actively advocating that the cities within your four counties request from you funding your county received (or is slated to receive) through the CARES Act. However, I want to note for the record that GMAs original proposal for a 50 C 50 split of funding was predicated upon population figures (incorporated versus unincorporated) that were inclusive of all the cities within your four counties, but not inclusive of the populations of your counties on the county side of the ledger. The final agreement ACCG reached with GMA still relied upon that 50 C 50 split on 70% of total funding we are seeking from the Governor. \\nI am letting you know about this because if the cities within your counties get funding through the sub-grants we have requested from the Governor, and get funding through the counties CARES allocation, they will be getting a double-dip so to speak. \\nI thought you ought to know. \\nSincerely, \\nDave Wills Executive Director Association County Commissioners of Georgia 191 Peachtree St., NE, Suite 700 Atlanta, GA 30303 404-683-1816 (Verizon Cellular) 404-583-7861 (Direct Fax) \\ndwills@accg.org \\n', 'from': ' Wills, Dave <DWills@ACCG.org> ', 'to': ' Nash, Charlotte <Charlotte.Nash@gwinnettcounty.com>; Robb Pitts <robb.pitts@fultoncountyga.gov>; Michael Thurmond (MLThurmond@dekalbcountyga.gov) <MLThurmond@dekalbcountyga.gov>; Mike Boyce (mike.boyce@cobbcounty.org) <mike.boyce@cobbcounty.org> ', 'date': ' Wednesday, April 29, 2020 2:23 PM ', 'subject': ' FW: Notes from 4.28.20 NACO Call w/ U S.

An official with the Treasury Department responded to many questions about the fund. Ive attached the notes that my colleague Kathleen Bowen took from that call. \\nOn a related note, Ive attached ACCGs blast email from yesterday, which you may have already seen. The first item relates to a proposal to the Governor regarding distribution of CRF money to local governments that did not receive direct CRF allocations. So while that does not directly impact your counties, note that the proposal would allow the cities in your counties (other than Atlanta) to participate in this separate distribution. I mention that in the event that any of your cities approach your counties asking for part of your direct CRF allocations. On the NACo call yesterday, the Treasury official stated that a direct CRF recipient county could choose to share some of that money with its constituent cities. However, if the Governor accepts this proposal, the cities in your counties will have an alternate route to seek an allocation of CRF funds from the state. \\nI hope all of you are well and hanging in there! \\nLarry \\n\\nLarry W.

The flattening of the curve and good planning have avoided an early catastrophic result. \\n3) In a next phase, testing becomes paramount. With the inclusion our new sites at WCA and 4700 NP, two retail sites, two National Guard sites and hospital partners, we have tested over 55K folks through yesterday. \\n4) To think boldly, we should consider testing all FC employees, all municipal employee and the population in general. We have asked EMSI and our teams to model the priorities, capacity and even marketing campaigns to drive behavior. However, even McKinseys effort to offer a strategy proved to be difficult. \\n5) The other element of a next phase of FC re-opening. Safety first will be our guiding principle. That requires PPE at scale for 90 days, building enhancements, employee testing and new protocols which are being carefully thought through. Anna Roach will cover the details with a target of June 1 thru July 1 for a phased opening. \\n6) We also continue to closely monitor the situation at the Jail which has been managed well. We are now finalizing plans for COVID-19 isolation unit at Rice street and Union City. \\n7) We are continue to support the community through the $10M package approved by the BOC and will provide a brief status on those payments. \\n8) As with all governments, we are in a conservative posture as it relates to our financial stability. As you recall, we implemented expanse controls and reserved $31M to cover near-term COVID-19 expenses. We have received CARES funding of $104M. We will share the most likely uses of that funding today. Having already spent or obligated $18M, we are on a monthly run rate to use these funds in their entirety. \\n9) We are also looking ahead to future revenue impacts from commercial property tax digest impacts and will argue to continued expense controls in light of great uncertainties. \\n10) In the end, I want to thank our leaders for their commitment to citizens and their creative approaches to managing some very complicated issues in an unprecedented time. \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\n', 'from': ' \"Anderson, Dick\" <Dick.Anderson@fultoncountyga.gov> ', 'to': ' \"Gillespie, Alana\" <alana.Gillespie@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Shedrick, Rosemary\" <Rosemary.Shedrick@fultoncountyga.gov> ', 'date': ' May 5, 2020 at 2:49:30 PM EDT ', 'subject': ' Pls print '}, {'id': 181, 'full_text': 'From: Anderson, Dick To: Dimond, Timothy Cc: Kallmyer, Matthew Subject: Fwd: PPE Vendor List from GEMA/HS Date: Monday, April 27, 2020 10:41:51 AM Attachments: image003.jpg \\nATT00001.htm Vendors for PPE 2020 04 27.pdf ATT00002.htm \\nTim \\nLets scan the list and determine if there are some that we havent contacted yet.

Specifically, the guidance centered around using the funds towards abating rent of business operators on the airfield. Business Operators are being defined as those companies that are based on the airfield and that earn their livelihood by providing air-related services. For Fulton County Executive, these include the 2 FBOs and the flight school. Tenants who rent hangar space from the County do not meet this definition and should not be given the abatement option according to the FAA. \\nOver the past few days, Public Works has been in conversations with the County Attorneys Office about this refined direction. Based on the new information, the County Attorneys Office is recommending that the topic be discussed with the Board \\nth \\nof Commissioners during the Executive Session on May 6 . I have attached a memo that more fully outlines the issue, FAAs guidance, and staff recommendations. \\nI will be available during the BOC meeting, if necessary to answer any questions.

I was told on Saturday, May 2, 2020 that our division is Not eligible for Hazard Pay after being told we were eligible a couple of weeks ago. Mr. Anderson I am so confused as to why we are no longer eligible. The Police Officers nor 911 cannot function without us and we cannot operate without them. Our 12 person staff not only services The Fulton County PD but we also service Palmetto PD/Fulton County School PD/Fairburn PD/Union City PD/Department of Juvenile Justice and City of South Fulton PD. We form a triangle C The Police/911 and GCIC whom all perform critical duties. Maybe it was not fully explained what exactly it is we do. \\nMr. Anderson if one of your love ones were missing and you wanted the police to assist with locating them, the first line of contact would be 911. Then 911 would dispatch an officer to your location to collect information so your love one can be placed on a National System which is GCIC/NCIC. That officer/detective would then forward the collected information to Fulton County GCIC for entry. That information is entered by one of our 12 GCIC Operators who work 24/7 all 365 days of the year. Any vehicles/wanted persons & articles are also entered by us. If a person commits a Murder in unincorporated Fulton County, that person must be placed on the system so that every police agency in the world is aware the he/she is wanted. That is done by our section. Mr. Anderson with all due respect I really dont understand how 911 Operators are eligible for Hazard Pay and GCIC Operators are not. We both are civilians who do not physically come in contact with the general public but neither of us can operate without the other. \\nThe FCPD has been closed to the public during Covid-19 but NOT GCIC because we are essential. However we have had to fingerprint numerous Officers and Judges during this time and that has placed each staff member in our section in a hazardous environment. If only Sworn Personnel are considered Emergency Essential then maybe we should look at only having officers handling GCIC/ finger printing and civilians should be placed on paid leave like the rest of the county. \\nMr. Anderson I am reaching out to you because I dont know what else to do. It doesnt seem like we have anyone to fight for us so I am willing to speak up on behalf of all 12 persons assigned to our division. I was contacted on Friday, May 1, 2020 by some of my co-workers and they were in tears because they feel unappreciated and hurt by the Personnel Directors decision to not include GCIC Operators in the Hazard Pay. I hope I have not over stepped any boundaries and if you feel I have, I deeply apologize. I just wanted each of my team members to know that they are appreciated and that someone is willing to fight for them!! \\nThanks for all your assistance with this matter and I hope you have a great weekend. \\n\\nGCIC Supervisor \\nGCIC/Records, Fulton County Police Department \\n404-613-7211 (office) \\n404-612-3426 (fax) \\nConnect with Fulton County: \\nWebsite | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | FGTV | #OneFulton E-News \\n', 'from': ' James, Diara ', 'to': ' Anderson, Dick ', 'date': ' Sunday, May 3, 2020 6:44:38 AM ', 'subject': ' Hazard Pay for GCIC Operators '}, {'id': 230, 'full_text': 'From: Moses, Tamikia \\nTo: Anderson, Dick \\nCc: Whitmore, Sharon; Hermon, Kenneth; Adams, Alton; Gammage, Keith \\nSubject: Letterhead - Mr Hermon \\nDate: Tuesday, April 28, 2020 4:27:43 PM \\nAttachments: image001.png Letterhead - Mr Hermon.docx \\nMr. Anderson, \\nI hope this message finds you well.

And we have seen the curve flatten in FC. \\n3) We completed another $2M in awards to a number of community based organizations such as QLS, GOODR, COUNCIL on AGING to support food insecurity, homelessness. \\n3) In this next phase, social distancing and many of precautions continue to be necessary. However, a measured set of steps are being planned as the State of GA moves forward. \\nWhat are some of those next steps? \\n1) We are significantly expanding our COVID-19 testing locations. \\n2) This week, we move from 2 to 6 locations and plans to test over 50K citizens in month of May. \\n3) We can expand rapidly by partnering with public and private partners...including the National Guard at Turner Field and Greenbrier Mall, CVS and Walgreens and FC at WCA and 4700 NP. \\n4) We also plan a very innovative approach to mobile testing using previous approach with HIV testing vans converted to COVID-19 vans. \\n5) We are also planning an isolation unit of 100-200 at the FC Jail as we plan for any worst cast scenario in those facilities. \\nWhen do we get back to normal? \\n1) It is certainly too early to say from the economy as well as from the health outlook. \\n2) However, we have begun planning necessary to re-open FC Government. \\n3) Our guiding principle is safety for public and for our employees. \\n4) I think you will see phases...courts and tax offices perhaps first, limited Library and BH services, and much later senior services and arts. \\n5) While no dates have been proposed, we will have proper PPE, building enhancements and protocols before we open and I expect the month of May to be largely about planning and perhaps June for some limited re-opening. \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\n', 'from': ' Anderson, Dick ', 'to': ' Shoates, Michael Cc: Chavis, Shaunya; Corbitt, Jessica B', 'date': ' Monday, April 27, 2020 9:09:40 AM ', 'subject': ' Pls print '}, {'id': 236, 'full_text': 'From: Anderson, Dick To: Gillespie, Alana; Shedrick, Rosemary Subject: Pls print Date: Tuesday, May 5, 2020 2:49:31 PM \\nBOC MEETING (5/6) \\n1) We continue make progress in our response to the COVID-19 crisis. \\n2) Most importantly, we have maintained healthy cushions in healthcare capacity with 846 beds. 195 ICU beds, 287, ventilators and 129 in expected morgue capacity. The flattening of the curve and good planning have avoided an early catastrophic result. \\n3) In a next phase, testing becomes paramount. With the inclusion our new sites at WCA and 4700 NP, two retail sites, two National Guard sites and hospital partners, we have tested over 55K folks through yesterday. \\n4) To think boldly, we should consider testing all FC employees, all municipal employee and the population in general. We have asked EMSI and our teams to model the priorities, capacity and even marketing campaigns to drive behavior. However, even McKinseys effort to offer a strategy proved to be difficult. \\n5) The other element of a next phase of FC re-opening. Safety first will be our guiding principle. That requires PPE at scale for 90 days, building enhancements, employee testing and new protocols which are being carefully thought through. Anna Roach will cover the details with a target of June 1 thru July 1 for a phased opening. \\n6) We also continue to closely monitor the situation at the Jail which has been managed well. We are now finalizing plans for COVID-19 isolation unit at Rice street and Union City. \\n7) We are continue to support the community through the $10M package approved by the BOC and will provide a brief status on those payments. \\n8) As with all governments, we are in a conservative posture as it relates to our financial stability. As you recall, we implemented expanse controls and reserved $31M to cover near-term COVID-19 expenses. We have received CARES funding of $104M. We will share the most likely uses of that funding today. Having already spent or obligated $18M, we are on a monthly run rate to use these funds in their entirety. \\n9) We are also looking ahead to future revenue impacts from commercial property tax digest impacts and will argue to continued expense controls in light of great uncertainties. \\n10) In the end, I want to thank our leaders for their commitment to citizens and their creative approaches to managing some very complicated issues in an unprecedented time. \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\n', 'from': ' Anderson, Dick ', 'to': ' Gillespie, Alana; Shedrick, Rosemary ', 'date': ' Tuesday, May 5, 2020 2:49:31 PM ', 'subject': ' Pls print '}, {'id': 237, 'full_text': 'From: Clark, David To: Anderson, Dick; Roach, Anna; Kirby, Ellis Cc: Stewart, Denval; Logan-Pugh, Joey; Dimond, Timothy; Beggerly, Timothy; Husserl, James Subject: Proposed CARES Act funding usage at Fulton County Executive Airport Date: Friday, May 1, 2020 2:33:41 PM Attachments: Proposed funding usage.pdf \\nDick: \\nEarlier this week, the FAA provided revised guidance on how the CARES Act funding can be used by general aviation airports. Specifically, the guidance centered around using the funds towards abating rent of business operators on the airfield. Business Operators are being defined as those companies that are based on the airfield and that earn their livelihood by providing air-related services. For Fulton County Executive, these include the 2 FBOs and the flight school. Tenants who rent hangar space from the County do not meet this definition and should not be given the abatement option according to the FAA. \\nOver the past few days, Public Works has been in conversations with the County Attorneys Office about this refined direction. Based on the new information, the County Attorneys Office is recommending that the topic be discussed with the Board of Commissioners during the Executive \\nSession on May 6th. I have attached a memo that more fully outlines the issue, FAAs guidance, and staff recommendations. \\nI will be available during the BOC meeting, if necessary to answer any questions. Also, Tim Beggerly and I will make ourselves available to the Managers Office early next week if you would like to discuss this matter in more detail as you prepare for the BOC meeting. \\n-David \\n', 'from': ' Clark, David ', 'to': ' Anderson, Dick; Roach, Anna; Kirby, Ellis ', 'date': ' Friday, May 1, 2020 2:33:41 PM ', 'subject': ' Proposed CARES Act funding usage at Fulton County Executive Airport '}, {'id': 238, 'full_text': 'From: Anderson, Dick To: Corbitt, Jessica Cc: Kallmyer, Matthew Subject: Re: [EXTERNAL] RE: AJC story - testing Date: Monday, April 27, 2020 11:20:12 PM \\nThanks \\nDick Anderson County Manager Fulton County 141 Pryor Street Atlanta, GA 30303 \\n404.612.8335(o) 404.808.4751(m) \\nOn Apr 27, 2020, at 10:46 PM, Corbitt, Jessica <Jessica.Corbitt@fultoncountyga.gov> wrote: \\nDick: Matt and I talked about this inquiry this evening and feel like it might be helpful toconnect Willoughby with Dr. Paxton to discuss part of this.

I did visits with Cobb and DeKalb SPOCs this week to get thoughts on what is working/not working. I haven\\'t known who to talk to about what Cobb is doing, but they process significantly more specimens than we do in much less time with far fewer staff members. Their system almost completely eliminates the need for schedulers and our WebEOC acheduling board. It also improves accuracy of data, while decreasing the number of Registration staff needed, reducing time spent entering data in SENDSS, allows for PUIs to be tested without an \"appointment\", and provides for a way to document consent for the BOH to contact. \\nFrom my experience working closely with the schedulers and Registration, I see where a rapid rollout of added schedulers may lead to an increase in errors that will need to be addressed at Registration (thereby increasing the time it takes to takes to move PUIs through the queue), issues around pacing appointments, errors with specimen count data (Tenny and I worked through one of these Friday), and increased challenges around communicating changes is plans/operations. Of course, we will do whatever it is leadership wants and we will work to resolve these issues. I just wanted to share an alternative approach that may also be driving more people to Cobb\\'s SPOC versus ours. \\nBest regards, \\nCorinna \\nSent from my Sprint Samsung Galaxy S9. \\n-------- Original message --------\\n', 'from': ' Hansen, Corinna ', 'to': ' Holland, David ', 'date': ' Saturday, April 25, 2020 5:32 PM', 'subject': ' RE: Call center info '}, {'id': 259, 'full_text': 'From: \"Holland, David\" <David.Holland@fultoncountyga.gov> \\nDate: 4/25/20 4:15 PM (GMT-05:00) \\nTo: \"Haynes, Sheena\" <Sheena.Haynes@fultoncountyga.gov>, Donnie Reece <donnie.reece@afcema.com>, \"Smith, Wendy\" <Wendy.Smith@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Khan, Fazle\" <Fazle.Khan@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Beecher, Gloria\" <Gloria.Beecher@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Turner, Kim\" <Kim.Turner@fultoncountyga.gov>, Matthew Kallmyer <matthew.kallmyer@afcema.com>, \"Paxton, Lynn\" <Lynn.Paxton@fultoncountyga.gov>, Joe Barasoain <Joe.barasoain@afcema.com>, \"Hansen, Corinna\" <Corinna.Hansen@fultoncountyga.gov> \\nSubject: RE: Call center info \\nSo to sum up: We can just go straight to WebEOC for scheduling, though it would be nice if we could add fields for the demographic info and something brief about symptoms and risk factors C it really comes down to what Epi needs on the back end.

I did visits with Cobb and DeKalb SPOCs this week to get thoughts on what is working/not working. I haven\\'t known who to talk to about what Cobb is doing, but they process significantly more specimens than we do in much less time with far fewer staff members. Their system almost completely eliminates the need for schedulers and our WebEOC acheduling board. It also improves accuracy of data, while decreasing the number of Registration staff needed, reducing time spent entering data in SENDSS, allows for PUIs to be tested without an \"appointment\", and provides for a way to document consent for the BOH to contact. \\nFrom my experience working closely with the schedulers and Registration, I see where a rapid rollout of added schedulers may lead to an increase in errors that will need to be addressed at Registration (thereby increasing the time it takes to takes to move PUIs through the queue), issues around pacing appointments, errors with specimen count data (Tenny and I worked through one of these Friday), and increased challenges around communicating changes is plans/operations. Of course, we will do whatever it is leadership wants and we will work to resolve these issues. I just wanted to share an alternative approach that may also be driving more people to Cobb\\'s SPOC versus ours. \\nBest regards, \\nCorinna \\nSent from my Sprint Samsung Galaxy S9. \\n-------- Original message --------\\n', 'from': ' Hansen, Corinna ', 'to': ' Holland, David ', 'date': ' Saturday, April 25, 2020 5:32 PM', 'subject': ' RE: Call center info '}, {'id': 272, 'full_text': 'From: \"Holland, David\" <David.Holland@fultoncountyga.gov> \\nDate: 4/25/20 4:15 PM (GMT-05:00) \\nTo: \"Haynes, Sheena\" <Sheena.Haynes@fultoncountyga.gov>, Donnie Reece <donnie.reece@afcema.com>, \"Smith, Wendy\" <Wendy.Smith@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Khan, Fazle\" <Fazle.Khan@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Beecher, Gloria\" <Gloria.Beecher@fultoncountyga.gov>, \"Turner, Kim\" <Kim.Turner@fultoncountyga.gov>, Matthew Kallmyer <matthew.kallmyer@afcema.com>, \"Paxton, Lynn\" <Lynn.Paxton@fultoncountyga.gov>, Joe Barasoain <Joe.barasoain@afcema.com>, \"Hansen, Corinna\" <Corinna.Hansen@fultoncountyga.gov> \\nSubject: RE: Call center info \\nSo to sum up: We can just go straight to WebEOC for scheduling, though it would be nice if we could add fields for the demographic info and something brief about symptoms and risk factors C it really comes down to what Epi needs on the back end.

I wanted to follow up on our conversation to see if Fulton County plans to have a local approach to contact tracing when Georgia begins to reopen. We work with a group called Westat out of Maryland and they have thousands of employees throughout the country that perform large health surveys and research studies for intuitions like NIH. As states and local governments look to navigate the path forward with COVID, they are interested in working with them to perform contact tracing. If there is any interest from Fulton County to meet with Westat in the future and learn more about their capabilities please let me know. If I should reach out directly to Fulton County Board of Health I can do that as well. Hope you and your family stay healthy and safe!

This obviously can reach far beyond health as there are many uses for these dollars including support for public employees. But where it would make sense to identify evidence based strategies, common community or private partners, address concerns that span jurisdictions or would require coordination to be as successful as possible (testing, tracing, any social supports for people in need etc.) it might be useful to find a forum to discuss. \\nDeKalb county and the City of Atlanta have already confirmed that they would be very interested in a call to discuss as soon as possible. \\nIf there is even a shred of interest in this, on Fultons part, please let me know.

Like millions of workers across America, my co-workers and I are a community that has risked our lives and compromised the health of family as well as ourselves in the midst of performing a job deemed essential for society. The extreme sacrifices we continue to make as frontline workers require an immediate response to those whose loved ones are booked-in and hopefully released as the jail continues to house those that have been infected and those that may be carriers of the virus as well. \\nWe trust on a daily basis that this facility will provide life-saving personal protective equipment (PPE) to shield us from this invisible enemy as well as provide stringent safety measures also. On March 20, 2020, we were provided with one N95 mask for the duration of this epidemic but can go through other measures to receive an additional one. This is unacceptable! But yet and still we arrive to work for our regularly scheduled shift. \\nIncluded in the mainstream media news on April 13, 2020 was the Fulton County Jail being sanitized and cleaned in order to aid in the eradication of the virus within the jail. We were ecstatic to hear the news except the Active Records Department was not included. We encounter those same inmates and officers that are in constant contact with the inmates housed in the jail. As of May 5, 2020, the Active Records department remains unscathed! In lieu of our department being included in the sanitation, we are asked to upkeep our area until further notice. When will we receive our initial sanitizing of our department? But yet and still we are essential to the process! \\nMany of us are the sole providers for our family. It is not enough to express our deepest concerns and they be ignored. We are held to the same standards of reporting come inclement weather in addition to presently reporting through this global pandemic. You will never feel nor understand the pain that we feel until you have actually worn our shoes. We hold the decision makers to a higher standard in making well thought out decisions. One can imagine the consequences the jail as a whole would suffer if the entire Intake and Booking as well as the Active Records Department would have only thought of our immediate family as well as ourselves. The results would have been detrimental to the entire Fulton County Jail. We value our jobs as well as our families and know that we need both to sustain. \\nFrom Doctors to delivery drivers, grocery store workers and care providers, detention officers to us as Criminal Investigation Service Technicians we are essential to the process. The panic on our faces are not seen while performing our duties and then go home to family in hopes that we have not contracted the virus nor transmitted it to anyone else. There should be no excuse why we are not included in the hazardous benefits. We are the ones taking the risk! We are the ones included in the exposure to COVID-19 in order to continue processing in-coming and releasing inmates. \\nHonestly, we cannot put an amount on how much is enough at risking our lives but what should be considered is our safety, our health and those again we compromise. Those included in our chain of command have expressed their gratitude but with this type of unprecedented event and high exposure a simply thank you is not enough! \\nLet this resonate from those that work the frontlineThose that are considered non-essential have to remain sheltered-in-place! Those that are deemed essential have to report! We know we are essential show us by allowing us to reap the benefits. \\nJ.

But yet and still we arrive to work for our regularly scheduled shift. \\nIncluded in the mainstream media news on April 13, 2020 was the Fulton County Jail being sanitized and cleaned in order to aid in the eradication of the virus within the jail. We were ecstatic to hear the news except the Active Records Department was not included. We encounter those same inmates and officers that are in constant contact with the inmates housed in the jail. As of May 5, 2020, the Active Records department remains unscathed! In lieu of our department being included in the sanitation, we are asked to upkeep our area until further notice. When will we receive our initial sanitizing of our department? But yet and still we are essential to the process! \\nMany of us are the sole providers for our family. It is not enough to express our deepest concerns and they be ignored. We are held to the same standards of reporting come inclement weather in addition to presently reporting through this global pandemic. You will never feel nor understand the pain that we feel until you have actually worn our shoes. We hold the decision makers to a higher standard in making well thought out decisions. One can imagine the consequences the jail as a whole would suffer if the entire Intake and Booking as well as the Active Records Department would have only thought of our immediate family as well as ourselves. The results would have been detrimental to the entire Fulton County Jail. We value our jobs as well as our families and know that we need both to sustain. \\nFrom Doctors to delivery drivers, grocery store workers and care providers, detention officers to us as Criminal Investigation Service Technicians we are essential to the process. The panic on our faces are not seen while performing our duties and then go home to family in hopes that we have not contracted the virus nor transmitted it to anyone else. There should be no excuse why we are not included in the hazardous benefits. We are the ones taking the risk! We are the ones included in the exposure to COVID-19 in order to continue processing in-coming and releasing inmates. \\nHonestly, we cannot put an amount on how much is enough at risking our lives but what should be considered is our safety, our health and those again we compromise. Those included in our chain of command have expressed their gratitude but with this type of unprecedented event and high exposure a simply thank you is not enough! \\nLet this resonate from those that work the frontlineThose that are considered non-essential have to remain sheltered-in-place! Those that are deemed essential have to report! We know we are essential show us by allowing us to reap the benefits. \\nJ.

We have agreed to lower some of the cost of the test kits, changing the price from $20 a kit to $18. More than making a profit we are concerned about helping as many people as possible get tested. The only breakthrough for this Pandemic is widespread testing. And hopefully we can help your city and state reach that point. I will be in surgery for the next couple of hours.

In the meantime we will continue to soldier on via email, phone calls and Zoom! \\nI actually want to assure you all that we at the Dept of Health are only interested in making sure that every Fulton County resident has access to testing and we will work with any group or organization that can make that a reality. We are not concerned with being the ones in control of every testing site. To achieve our goal of accessible testing, we are proceeding on several fronts: \\n1)Dr. Holland and I are reviewing all the available data about all current testing locations, location of cases ('hotspots'), and demographics to assess coverage and guide our planning. \\n2) As you know, the mobile testing sites are starting out tomorrow. We will be closely evaluating them over the coming days and making adjustments as necessary. \\n3) I will be closely working with our Communications teams so that we can improve our outreach to the community and our media presence. We should also be exploring different avenues to get the message out which may include some that we may not have used in the past. \\n4) It is apparent that we need to foster better communications between all the actors in this endeavor. It will be no secret to you that there have been some serious hiccups in the past weeks with plans to set up SPOCs in certain areas being derailed at the last minute because of miscommunications or power struggles. It has been very much a moving target but it is my aim to do my utmost to help bring some order to the process as I grow into my new role. I look forward to working with you all in that regard. I know that you all have a wealth of ideas and experience that I am eager to tap into. Do feel free to call or email me at anytime. \\nBest, Lynn \\nLynn A. Paxton M.D., M.P.H.

May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus) before permitting employees to enter the workplace? 4/23/20 \\nThe ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be \"job related and consistent with business necessity.\" Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take steps to determine if employees entering the workplace have COVID-19 because an individual with the virus will pose a direct threat to the health of others. Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID-19 testing to employees before they enter the workplace to determine if they have the virus. \\nConsistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities, and check for updates. Employers may wish to consider the incidence of false-positives or false-negatives associated with a particular test. Finally, note that accurate testing only reveals if the virus is currently present; a negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later. \\nBased on guidance from medical and public health authorities, employers should still require \\n-to the greatest extent possible - that employees observe infection control practices (such as social distancing, regular handwashing, and other measures) in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID-19. \\nKenneth L.

The way to do so was as Deputy in EMA and put him in charge of SPOCs. I negotiated with him last Saturday. Then, was the ability to recruit Jack Butler to come back. We can plug him in immediately and \\nthen long-term, he can run the AARF and EMS and move function from Chris and let him \\nfocus on 911 alone. Last, the ability to bring in the 2-3 guys on loan from the host committee completes the picture. \\nSo, this accomplished the three goals and I am driving to get in place.

Strange times indeed. \\nThere is one situation that I want to bring to the Citys attention concerning the activity usage at Garrard Landing Park. As you know, the City has closed the Citys parking lot typically used by the general public in an attempt to limit the parks usage. However, this has resulted in residents parking in the Johns Creek Environmental Campus parking lot. This afternoon there were over 40 cars parked in the lot in order to walk over to the park, including many areas designated as no parking. \\nAt this time, I just wanted the City to know of the situation. We are monitoring it and if the excessive parking continues to interfere with the operations of the facility, we will consider closing the parking lot to all users. Fulton County appreciates the partnership that we have at this site and hope that we can continue to coordinate the future opening of the Garrard Landing Park and parking lot. \\nDavid E. Clark, P.E.

Anderson, I was listening to Gov Cuomo, as I do each morning, and he shared a plan with the public, along with Mayor Blumberg, which I texted to Mayor Edwards. I would like to share that text with you, as I thought it sounded great, and doable. They were discussing developing a Public Tracing Program for public release to that other agencies can use it to track and monitor the coronavirus. With Mayor Blumberg\\'s technical support, it sounds like they could collaborate on a system for tracking contacts. Personally, I am not concerned about them knowing when and where I go, as they probably know that already. Just sharing the idea as it seems to be the only way to defeat this virus. Everybody else is fighting over the rights to any vaccine - big pharma, and Trump wants to make sure they get a piece of the action. I don\\'t know what happened to CDC and FDA approval.

I and many others come in contact with the public daily. This includes people from all walks of life. We the civilians, are frontline essential workers that risk our lives and our family lives, when we come into work daily. Numbers do not lie. Today we were told that there are 6 employees and 31 inmates that have tested positive for this virus. There was testing done on site recently and the number of positive individuals with this virus is going up. This fact lets you know that there is still cause for alarm or concern. \\nThis hazard pay will give the civilians some compensation for the brave ones who continue to fight this disease. The civilians at the jail want adequate compensation and support for putting our lives on the line. The jail is an essential business that needs to operate and continue operating just as the hospital workers, the nursing homes, public transportation and the super markets. This is an insult to the civilians that work at the jail. There were Security Specialists who are not sworn staff and do not come in direct contact with the inmates, still received hazardous pay. The civilians received an official letter allowing permission to be out and not stay inside, due to being an essential employee, but not being able to receive hazard pay. \\nIn the beginning of this uncertain pandemic, the civilians in Booking and Intake, continued to risk their lives without proper professional protective equipment. Not knowing the true facts we still came in to perform our daily duties. Again, I strongly urge you to issue hazard pay to the jail civilians. This step is very necessary to compensate and continue with the heroism and risk of the jail employees. \\nEunice Oneil CIS Technician Fulton Count Sheriffs Dept.

I \\nwas told on Saturday, May 2, 2020 that our division is Not eligible for Hazard Pay \\nafter being told we were eligible a couple of weeks ago. Mr. Anderson I am so confused as to why we are no longer eligible. The Police Officers nor 911 cannot function without us and we cannot operate without them. Our 12 person staff not only services The Fulton County PD but we also service Palmetto PD/Fulton County School PD/Fairburn PD/Union City PD/Department of Juvenile Justice and City of South Fulton PD. We form a triangle C The Police/911 and GCIC whom all perform critical duties. Maybe it was not fully explained what exactly it is we do. \\nMr. Anderson if one of your love ones were missing and you wanted the police to assist with locating them, the first line of contact would be 911. Then 911 would dispatch an officer to your location to collect information so your love one can be placed on a National System which is GCIC/NCIC. That officer/detective would then forward the collected information to Fulton County GCIC for entry. That information is entered by one of our 12 GCIC Operators who work 24/7 all 365 days of the year. Any vehicles/wanted persons & articles are also entered by us. If a person commits a Murder in unincorporated Fulton County, that person must be placed on the system so that every police agency in the world is aware the he/she is wanted. That is done by our section. Mr. Anderson with all due respect I really dont understand how 911 Operators are eligible for Hazard Pay and GCIC Operators are not. We both are civilians who do not physically come in contact with the general public but neither of us can operate without the other. \\nThe FCPD has been closed to the public during Covid-19 but NOT GCIC because we are essential. However we have had to fingerprint numerous Officers and Judges during this time and that has placed each staff member in our section in a hazardous environment. If only Sworn Personnel are considered Emergency Essential then maybe we should look at only having officers handling GCIC/ finger printing and civilians should be placed on paid leave like the rest of the county. \\nMr. Anderson I am reaching out to you because I dont know what else to do. It doesnt seem like we have anyone to fight for us so I am willing to speak up on behalf of all 12 persons assigned to our division. I was contacted on Friday, May 1, 2020 by some of my co-workers and they were in tears because they feel unappreciated and hurt by the Personnel Directors decision to not include GCIC Operators in the Hazard Pay. I hope I have not over stepped any boundaries and if you feel I have, I deeply apologize. I just wanted each of my team members to know that they are appreciated and that someone is willing to fight for them!! \\nThanks for all your assistance with this matter and I hope you have a great weekend. \\nDiara S.

Then 911 would dispatch an officer to your location to collect information so your love one can be placed on a National System which is GCIC/NCIC. That officer/detective would then forward the collected information to Fulton County GCIC for entry. That information is entered by one of our 12 GCIC Operators who work 24/7 all 365 days of the year. Any vehicles/wanted persons & articles are also entered by us. If a person commits a Murder in unincorporated Fulton County, that person must be placed on the system so that every police agency in the world is aware the he/she is wanted.

County officials presented evidence indicating that although social distancing and wearing protective gear help in continuing to fight the spread, additional measures are necessary to not only help reduce new cases of Coronavirus but in helping the county to reopen. \\nWe want to make sure that our employees are safe and healthy before bringing them back to work, said Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts. Its vital that we have a plan in place that will help us to not protect the employees, but the residents of Fulton County. \\nFulton County Manager Dick Anderson and his team presented a proposed plan to the Commissioners outlining possible indicators that will assist in reopening the county to include: \\n-Determining whether the total number of cases in the community is flat or decreasing -Determining the countys ability to test 100% of the employees returning to work. -Determining the county ability to implement temperature screenings and provide personal \\nprotective equipment (PPE) to every employee interacting with the public \\nCounty officials will also continue implementing enhanced cleaning of its facilities and install signage that will inform residents of services and disease prevention instruction. The plan also recommends phasing in county offices over a two-month period beginning May 15 and ending with all offices possibly being opened by mid-July. \\nIt remains critical that we work to ensure that the growth of cases be sufficiently contained to protect the health and safety of our employees and the community, said Anderson. This impact of the virus has been hard for many of us, but we are now on a path for steady progress and sheltering in place a while longer will keep us on course. \\n\"The extended emergency order will allow us to carefully review our progress while we continue to provide the services our residents need, said Fulton County Chief Operating Officer Anna Roach. Our goal is to build an essential public health infrastructure by using measures such as employee testing and implementing a gradual reopening plan. \\nThe Fulton County Board of Commissioners will continue reviewing plans to reopen at its next meeting on May 20, 2020. \\nFor more Fulton County news, sign up for the weekly e-newsletter #OneFulton at https //goo.gl/Nb1L84.

We are bringing this to your attention because we are concerned that being deprived of this space will impact our ability to effectively represent our clients, and will result in delaying court cases and getting people released from the jail in a timely manner. We have used this office space for approximately 20 years and it is necessary for our operations; we use it to have early and ongoing contact with our clients throughout the pendency of their cases. Removing us from that space will result in delaying our communication with our clients, thereby decreasing our ability to resolve cases. This will result in increasing the jail population, even as we have worked so hard to get the numbers down. \\nAdditionally, given that we were given this information verbally yesterday and only in writing today, we cannot possibly move these 2 offices, including copy machines and furniture, within the time frame outlined.

I would like to know who do we contact if we are not getting resolution from animal control? The pit bull below has been spotted in my yard and my neighborhood multiple times, as recently as this morning. Saturday when it was in my yard, while me and my family were in the out there, I called animal control and they returned the call and stated it was nothing they could do because of COVID-19. The children are out of school and are playing outside this is very dangerous. We spotted the dog yesterday when we were riding bikes and my husband spotted it in our yard again this morning when he was doing yard work and just put up our eight pounds toy poodle. Additionally our neighbor was outside with her one year old daughter. I called animal control today and the first person told me we needed to pick the dog up and bring it to them, I responded a pit bull really. This is completely out of hand and we are not comfortable in our own yard. Any direction for resolution you can give would be appreciated. \\nRakesha Shank-Jones The Summit At Stonewall Tell 6270 Stonelake Dr \\nMobile - 770.354.7370 \\nThank you for your assistance with this matter. \\n\\n<image006.jpg> \\nRakesha Shank-Jones, M.

While I was waiting for her response, Mayor Williams himself called me and his call was followed up by another call from Mr. George Martin, the Chief Operating Officer of Christian City. Those calls helped me understand the issue better and their specific needs. \\nAs Jessica mentioned in her email, the Mayors concern is about all the residents of all the facilities there, especially of the Active Senior Living and Assisted Living Centers. The concern is based on the fact that there were several cases among residents and staff recently (in the last ten days) and includes two deaths in residents. We are aware of those cases and deaths C Carla from the Skilled Nursing & Rehabilitation Center (where all the cases are from) kept us posted. They (the Nursing and Rehabilitation Center) recently got all their residents and 31 staff tested at their facility through their contract with Capstone. \\nMany of those tested positive were asymptomatic at the time of testing. The Mayor and the COO are concerned about that more than anything else, afraid that these asymptomatic positive individuals might unknowingly infect the other vulnerable residents of the Assisted Living facility and in the HUD Apartment buildings. They have a total of about 1000 residents in all those complexes. \\nThey are requesting testing of all these approximately 850 residents and suggested sending a Mobile Testing Unit there.

I just got a call from Union City Mayor Vince Williams. He is requesting assistance from the Health Department in increasing COVID-19 testing onsite at the Christian City 500-acre complex in Union City. \\nThis property includes a skilled nursing facility as well as apartments for seniors. There are approximately 1000 residents total. The address of the property is 7345 Red Oak Road, Union City, GA 30291. They also have some children in a group home setting on the property. \\nHe said there had already been a few positive cases at this property and is concerned about spread among the residents after reading about some of the other issues in senior living facilities. \\nHe asked if it is possible for the health department to do widespread testing among residents at Christian City. Mayor Williams can be reached via cell # at 770-355-0897. \\nThank you. \\nJessica A.

We have assets in play that could be leveraged at a moments notice as it relates to a testing education and messaging strategy. \\nTwo ways we can help: \\n1. \\nUse the GeorgiaALIVE web platform to house testing locations and pertinent site/platform specific information, regardless of entity sponsor. In the messaging, wed suggest messaging testing criteria (who should get tested as the call to action). This listing would not preclude all other efforts C but could serve as a central point for all to find the critical information they need to know (location, registration process, etc.). \\n\\n2. \\nLeverage our existing creative platform to extend to and focus on testing.
